# XXE Payload Repository

Welcome to the XXE Payload Repository! This repository contains a collection of XML External Entity (XXE) payloads that can be used for testing and understanding XXE vulnerabilities in web applications.

## What is XXE?

XXE (XML External Entity) is a type of vulnerability that occurs when an XML parser processes external entities within XML documents. Attackers can exploit XXE vulnerabilities to disclose confidential data, execute remote code, or perform other malicious actions.

## Usage

The payloads in this repository can be used to test web applications for XXE vulnerabilities. You can inject these payloads into XML input fields or XML files processed by the application to check if it's vulnerable to XXE attacks.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have additional XXE payloads or improvements to existing ones, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that all payloads are tested and safe to use before submitting.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Do not use these payloads to attack systems without proper authorization. The maintainers of this repository are not responsible for any misuse of the payloads contained herein.
